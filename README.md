 - I have ideas what i want to do but implementation is hard.This was realy a challenge for me
 - Having problem using pen
 - Well i have got some messy work done but i think thats all i can do for now need more practice
 - I wanted to incoprate text with my logo just cant figure out how so i am going to proced to next step
  if i have time left will try that again

 - I tried to create 4 of these but this is what i could get
 - let's see my mood board 

  ![updated MoodBoard](images/updated-moodboard.PNG)

 - In my updated moodboard i have got image, its so silly idea i dont even know why i added this in there.
   while i was working on it just hit me so i just put in on canvas LOL
 - Ok time for  clean up and start coding
 - So i started exporting from figma i was having problem with `width and height` of the logo and i had too many paths so i used boolean groups. After that i had to change width and height in `svgomg` too. 
- When i was done with logo design then css styling was real simple
- Well great learning experience once i understood tools and little things it was preaty good to work on
- I am still having problem with image part it is not shrinking need check that out
